# Project Description
Our final project is an application that allows users to log and manage their
character builds for the video game Honkai: Star Rail. Each build includes
information about the selected character, light cone, and relics. Users can view
detailed information regarding the different relations, such as character stats and
rarities. The application also provides aggregated summary statistics to give users
insights into their overall build collection. Ultimately, the app helps users organize
and better understand their builds, as well as the gameâ€™s characters, light cones,
and relics in an interactive way.
